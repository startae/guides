# Code Reviews

A guide for reviewing code and having your code reviewed.

## Everyone

* Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly.
* Ask questions, don't give orders. (`"What do you think about doing this that other way?"` instead of `"Do this that other way."`)
* Ask for clarification. (`"I didn't understand. Can you clarify?"`)
* Avoid selective ownership of code. (`"mine"`, `"not mine"`, `"yours"`)
* Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. (`"dumb"`, `"stupid"`).
* Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.
* Don't use `"always"`, `"never"`, `"endlessly"` or `"nothing"`.
* Make a call/Talk in person if there are too many `"I didn't understand"` or `"Alternative solution:"` comments. Post a follow-up comment summarizing the discussion.


## Having Your Code Reviewed

* Don't take it personally. The review is of the code, not you.
* Be grateful for the reviewer's suggestions. (`"Good call. I'll make that change."`)
* Explain why the code exists. (`"It's like that because of x, y and z reasons."`)
* Push commits based on earlier rounds of feedback as isolated commits to the branch.
* Try to respond to every comment.
* Merge once you feel confident in the code and its impact on the project.

## Reviewing Code

Understand why the code is necessary (bug, user experience, refactoring). Then:

* Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't.
* Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
* Seek to understand the author's perspective.
* Sign off on the pull request with a :thumbsup: or "LGTM" comment.
